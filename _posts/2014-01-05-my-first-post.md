title: 2014, my first post!
---

With the start of the new year I have finally made the resolution to start a blog about my professional life!

I make a living for me and my family as Web developer. I am very passionate about *JavaScript*, *maps*, *data visualizations* and *design*. I am planning for this blog to be focused on data visualizations, particularly from a front-end developer's perspective.

Why data-story?

This was the name for a [project](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyT-KO2s4MY) I started a couple of years ago with 2 friends, [Xiaoying Riley](http://xiaoyingriley.com/) and [Kevin Mahoney](http://kevinmahoney.co.uk/). The project is now sadly deceased and I was left with the domain, hence the name.

I hope you will find my future posts interesting!
