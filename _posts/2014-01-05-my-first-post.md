title: My first post!
---

2014 begins and I finally made the resolution to start a blog about my professional life!

I make a living for myself and my family as Web developer and I am passionate about *JavaScript*, *maps*, *data visualizations* and *design*. I see my blog being particularly focused around data visualizations, from a front-end developer's perspective.

Why data-story?

This was the name for a [project](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyT-KO2s4MY) I started a couple of years ago with 2 friends, [Xiaoying Riley](http://xiaoyingriley.com/) and [Kevin Mahoney](http://kevinmahoney.co.uk/). The project is now sadly dead and I was left with the domain, hence the idea for the name.

Its start is bare boned, but it will grow!
