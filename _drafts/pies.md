title: Are pie charts really that bad?
---

<p>Let me start by saying that I do not like pie charts. A statement probably more tied to a feeling of uneasiness due to their huge success, rather than to any intrinsic weakness about them in visualizing data. But leaving personal feelings aside, pie charts still remain a not so good visual encoding for representing what we call "parts of a whole" data.
The reason is simple, they rely on area and angle to encode information, visual properties our brains have some difficulty in measuring. Nevertheless, the use of pie charts can still lead to successful visualizations, as I happened to recently learn.</p>

<p>The story is short. A client asks for a visualization about a world level regional breakdown of a number of suppliers for a big multinational company, suggesting the use of different sized pie charts over a global map. The final result is similar to the one below, but with data, countries and products are all different for confidentiality reasons.</p>
